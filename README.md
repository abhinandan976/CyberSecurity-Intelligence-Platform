# Cybersecurity Intelligence Platform
An automated multi-agent system that scans for real-time cybersecurity threats (CVEs) from live APIs, generates specific mitigation plans, and automatically writes professional intelligence reports in both Markdown and PDF formats.

## Core Features

Multi-Agent System: A 4-agent factory-style pipeline (Gatherer, Researcher, Manager, Scribe) that ensures a clean, sequential workflow.

Real-Time Threat Data: Connects directly to the official NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API to fetch live threat data.

Automated Threat-to-Action Analysis: The system automatically links active threats and vulnerabilities directly to a list of specific, actionable mitigation steps.

Dual Report Generation: Automatically creates a comprehensive intelligence report in two formats:

Markdown (.md): For easy reading and version control.

PDF (.pdf): For professional distribution and archiving.

Rule-Based Logic: Uses a fast, reliable, and offline internal rules engine to generate analysis (no LLM/GPU required for this version).

LLM-Ready: The project is pre-built to be easily upgradeable to use a local Large Language Model (like Llama 3 or Phi-3) for more dynamic AI-based analysis.

2. Create a Virtual EnvironmentIt's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

## Activate it

## 1. Active Threat Analysis & Response
This section links active threats directly to their recommended mitigation strategies.

### 1.1 Threat: Ransomware Campaign Targeting Healthcare Sector

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Source:** Simulated Threat Intel  
**Description:** New ransomware variant 'BlackCat 2.0' actively targeting...

**üîµ RECOMMENDED ACTION:**

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Recommendations:**
- Implement robust backup and recovery procedures (3-2-1 rule)
- Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions

**Implementation Steps:**
- Verify all critical data backups are offline and immutable
- Configure EDR to block common ransomware behaviors
